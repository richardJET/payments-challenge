Payments Challenge

Objective: Design and implement a user interface for a simplified payment processing application using React. Your UI should be able to conceptually integrate with a mock payment service and include a design for a plugin system that facilitates the easy addition of new payment methods or services.

 

Requirements:

Frontend:
Create a user-friendly interface using React that enables users to select from multiple payment methods.
The UI should feature at least:
A menu for selecting different payment methods.
A dynamic payment form that adjusts according to the selected payment method.
A confirmation page displayed after a simulated payment process.

Plugin System Concept:
Develop a conceptual framework for a plugin system within your application that allows for the straightforward integration of new payment methods without needing to alter the core codebase. Your submission should detail:
How the plugin system would function.
A mock-up or comprehensive description of integrating a new payment method plugin.

Documentation:
Include a README file with:
Setup and run instructions for your application.
An overview of your applicationâ€™s architecture and the reasons behind your design choices.
A conceptual guide on how to add a new payment method plugin.
